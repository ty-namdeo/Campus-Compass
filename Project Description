The annual influx of over 2,500 new students on large college campuses necessitates efficient
onboarding strategies to address the challenges freshmen face in navigating unfamiliar
environments, locating resources, and obtaining timely information. This project tackles these
issues by developing a customizable Virtual Assistant designed to bridge the freshman
onboarding gap. Leveraging firsthand freshman experience, the Virtual Assistant focuses on
providing campus navigation and serving as a centralized information hub, delivering instant
access to details about departments, faculty, and campus events. This innovative solution not
only empowers new students but also optimizes campus operations, creating a win-win
scenario for all stakeholders. By implementing Botpress and WIX Studio frameworks, the
chatbot ensures scalable, adaptable virtual assistance capabilities and user-friendly
interactions, guaranteeing long-term value. The successful deployment of this chatbot is
expected to yield significant benefits for both students and college administration, enhancing
the overall onboarding experience and operational efficiency.
